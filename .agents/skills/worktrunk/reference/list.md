# wt list

List worktrees and their status.

Shows uncommitted changes, divergence from the default branch and remote, and optional CI status and LLM summaries.

The table renders progressively: branch names, paths, and commit hashes appear immediately, then status, divergence, and other columns fill in as background git operations complete.

## Full mode

`--full` adds the two columns that reach off-machine: [CI status](#ci-status) (GitHub/GitLab pipeline pass/fail, over the network) and [LLM-generated summaries](#llm-summaries) of each branch's changes. The `main…±` line diffs are local git, so they show by default.

## Examples

List all worktrees:

```console

```

Output as JSON for scripting:

```console
$ wt list --format=json
```

## Columns

| Column | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| Branch | Branch name, elided with `…` past 32 characters so one long name can't size the column for every row (`--format=json` keeps it whole); a detached worktree has none, so it shows its short hash in dim yellow |
| Status | Compact symbols (see below) |
| HEAD± | Uncommitted changes, including untracked files: +added -deleted lines |
| main↕ | Commits ahead/behind default branch |
| main…± | Line diffs since the merge-base (three-dot) with the default branch |
| Summary | LLM-generated branch summary; requires `--full`, `summary = true`, and [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit) |
| Remote⇅ | Commits ahead/behind tracking branch |
| CI | PR/MR number colored by pipeline status; `--full` only |
| Path | Worktree directory |
| URL | Dev server URL from project config; dimmed if port is not listening |
| *(custom)* | User-defined [custom columns](#custom-columns) from `[list.custom-columns]` user config [experimental] |
| Commit | Short hash, abbreviated per `core.abbrev` |
| Age | Time since last commit |
| Message | Last commit message (truncated) |

The `main↕` and `main…±` headers keep the familiar `main` label in every repository.

The table sizes itself to the terminal. When the columns don't all fit, the least important go first — roughly right to left, since the order above runs from identity to nice-to-have — and the summary footer names them (`hidden: Commit, Age, Message`). A column with nothing to show on any row — `Remote⇅` in a repo with no remote — ranks below every populated column, so it goes first. A wider terminal brings them back. To pin a set rather than leave it to the width, name the columns in [`[list] columns`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#list); `--format=json` carries every field at any width.

`main↕` and `main…±` measure against the default branch's upstream tip when the local copy lags it — so in a fork whose local `main` trails `origin/main`, a branch reads as ahead of the real mainline, not of a stale local checkout. The `↑`/`↓`/`↕` Status symbols derive from these counts, so they track the upstream tip too.

### Gutter

The leftmost column marks each row by physical presence, from most present to least:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `@` | Current worktree |
| `^` | Primary worktree (the repo's home worktree) |
| `+` | Other worktree |
| `/` | Local branch without a worktree (`--branches`) |
| `\|` | Remote branch, not present locally until fetched (`--remotes`) |

### CI status

The CI column shows the branch's open PR/MR — `#3035` on GitHub, Gitea, and Azure DevOps, `!3035` on GitLab — colored by pipeline status, or a bare `#` when no number is available (e.g. branch workflows without a PR/MR). One color folds two JSON fields: green/blue/red/yellow/gray are the pipeline state, magenta/cyan the review state. The `Value` column names each state; [checks object](#checks-object) and [review states](#review-states) give the JSON spelling — schema 2 reports three of the pipeline values by the shape of `pr` and `checks` rather than as a `checks.status` string:

| Indicator | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `#` green | `"passed"` | All checks passed |
| `#` blue | `"running"` | Checks in progress |
| `#` red | `"failed"` | One or more checks failed |
| `#` yellow | `"conflicts"` | Merge conflicts with the target branch |
| `#` gray | `"no-ci"` | No PR/MR, or no checks configured |
| `⚠` yellow | `"error"` | CI status could not be fetched (rate limit, network, etc.) |
| `#` magenta | `"changes_requested"` | A reviewer requested changes |
| `#` cyan | `"pending"` | A review is required (e.g. branch protection) but not yet given |
| (blank) | `pr` and `checks` absent | No upstream, or no PR/MR and no branch workflow |

The two remaining review states have no indicator of their own: `"draft"` only dims the cell and `"approved"` leaves the color unchanged.

Color precedence resolves the fold: changes-requested (magenta) outranks running checks — waiting can't clear it — while an outstanding required review (cyan) only recolors an otherwise green or quiet branch. Cool colors mean waiting, warm colors mean act. An approved PR, or one with no review signal at all (no required reviewers and no reviews), keeps its plain pipeline color — `pr.review` is then `"approved"` or absent, respectively. GitLab MR data carries only `"pending"` and `"draft"` — no approved or changes-requested signal.

CI cells are clickable links to the PR or pipeline page, and appear dimmed for a draft PR/MR (`"draft"`) or when unpushed local changes make the status stale (`checks.stale`). PRs/MRs are checked first, then branch workflows/pipelines for branches with an upstream. Local-only branches show blank; remote-only branches — visible with `--remotes` — get CI status detection. Results are cached for 30-60 seconds; use `wt config state cache` to view or clear.

### LLM summaries

Reuses the [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit) command — the same LLM that generates commit messages. Enable with `summary = true` in `[list]` config; requires `--full`. Results are cached until the branch's diff changes.

### Custom columns [experimental]

Each `[list.custom-columns]` entry in user config adds a column: the key is the header, the template renders each row's cell. Templates read two per-branch namespaces — `{{ vars.* }}`, stored with [`wt config state vars set`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars), and `{{ git.branch.* }}`, the branch's own git config under `branch.<name>.*` (a `jira` key you set yourself, or the git-native `description`) — useful for tracking what each of many (often agent-driven) branches is for:

```toml
[list.custom-columns.Ticket]
template = "{{ vars.ticket }}"
```

A custom column that renders empty for every row is dropped from the table outright, rather than merely ranked last as an empty built-in is. Templates, widths, and drop priority: [custom columns config](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#custom-columns).

## Status symbols

The Status column packs several subcolumns, left to right, each mapping to a schema-2 field in `--format=json` (schema 1 spells several of them differently — see [Schema 1](#schema-1)). Working-tree flags are independent and co-occur — any combination shows at once. The other subcolumns are mutually exclusive: each shows a single symbol, the highest-priority state in top-to-bottom table order, and is blank when nothing applies.

### Working tree

Independent flags from `git status`; several can show at once (e.g. `+!?`). Each maps to a boolean in the [changes object](#changes-object):

| Symbol | worktree.changes | Meaning |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| `+` | `staged` | Staged files |
| `!` | `modified` | Modified files (unstaged) |
| `?` | `untracked` | Untracked files |

`worktree.changes` also reports `renamed` and `deleted`, which have no dedicated symbol in the column.

### Worktree

An in-progress git operation, a worktree-location attribute, or a branch with no worktree. One symbol shows, highest priority first (`✘ > ↻ > ⊟ > ⊞ > ⊘ > ⚑ > /`):

| Symbol | JSON | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `✘` | `worktree.changes.conflicted` | Merge conflicts |
| `↻` | `worktree.operation` `"rebase"`, `"merge"`, `"cherry_pick"`, `"revert"`, `"bisect"` | A git operation is in progress; `git status` names it |
| `⊟` | `worktree.prunable` | Prunable (worktree directory missing); nothing can be read from a directory that isn't there, so the row's data cells stay blank |
| `⊞` | `worktree.locked` | Locked worktree |
| `⊘` | `worktree.detached` | Detached HEAD — the worktree is on a commit, not a branch, which is why its Branch cell holds a short hash |
| `⚑` | `worktree.duplicate_branch` | Branch checked out in more than one worktree, so `wt` resolves it to whichever git lists first; every worktree on the branch is flagged |
| `⚑` | `worktree.branch_mismatch` | Worktree isn't at the path its branch implies |
| `/` | no `worktree` object | Branch without a worktree |

### Default branch

The single highest-priority state describing the branch's relation to the default branch; blank when none applies (a normal up-to-date branch). Each symbol is one `display.state` value:

| Symbol | display.state | Meaning |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `^` | `"is_main"` | The main worktree (the repo's home worktree) |
| `∅` | `"orphan"` | No common ancestor with the default branch |
| `_` | `"empty"` | Same commit as the default branch, working tree clean — safe to remove; row dimmed |
| `⊂` | `"integrated"` | Content [integrated](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/#branch-cleanup) into the default branch or merge target via different history; the matching check is in `default_branch.integration.reason`; row dimmed |
| `✗` | `"would_conflict"` | Merging into the default branch would conflict (simulated with `git merge-tree`) and the branch isn't already integrated; with `--full`, the check includes tracked uncommitted changes |
| `–` | `"same_commit"` | Same commit as the default branch, but with uncommitted changes |
| `↕` | `"diverged"` | Both ahead of and behind the default branch |
| `↑` | `"ahead"` | Has commits the default branch doesn't |
| `↓` | `"behind"` | Missing commits the default branch has |

Rows are dimmed when [safe to delete](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/#branch-cleanup) — `_` (`"empty"`) or `⊂` (`"integrated"`).

### Remote

Relation to the tracking branch, derived from the `upstream.ahead` / `upstream.behind` counts; blank when there is no upstream:

| Symbol | upstream | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `\|` | `ahead` 0, `behind` 0 | In sync with remote |
| `⇡` | `ahead` > 0 | Ahead of remote |
| `⇣` | `behind` > 0 | Behind remote |
| `⇅` | `ahead` > 0, `behind` > 0 | Diverged from remote |

### Marker

The last subcolumn carries the branch's own marker — whatever
[`wt config state marker set`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-marker) stored, usually
an emoji, which is why the subcolumn is two cells wide. Nothing in `wt` writes
it; it is there for agents and scripts to say what a branch is for, and it
reads back as the item's `marker` field. `wt config state marker set 🤖` on a
branch whose default-branch state is `_` renders `_ 🤖` in the column and
`"_🤖"` in `display.symbols`.

### Placeholder symbols

These appear across all columns while the table is loading:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `·` | Data is loading, or collection timed out / branch too stale |

---

## JSON output

`--format=json` emits schema 2 by default: the envelope format below. Set
`[list] json-schema = 1` to retain the original bare-array format.

### Schema 2

One envelope object. Items carry independent facts; rendered strings
(including the collapsed Status value) live under `display`:

```json
{
  "schema": 2,
  "repo": {
    "default_branch": "main",
    "forge": {"url": "https://github.com/org/repo", "provider": "github",
              "host": "github.com", "owner": "org", "name": "repo", "remote": "origin"}
  },
  "collected": {"ci": false, "summary": false},
  "items": [
    {
      "branch": "feature",
      "head": {"sha": "05a4a45d…", "short_sha": "05a4a45", "subject": "Add login page",
               "committed_at": "2025-01-01T08:00:00Z"},
      "worktree": {"path": "/home/user/repo.feature", "main": false, "current": true,
                   "previous": false, "detached": false, "branch_mismatch": false,
                   "duplicate_branch": false,
                   "changes": {"staged": false, "modified": true, "untracked": false,
                               "renamed": false, "deleted": false, "conflicted": false,
                               "diff": {"added": 10, "deleted": 2}}},
      "default_branch": {"ahead": 3, "behind": 1, "diff": {"added": 50, "deleted": 20},
                         "orphan": false, "integration": null, "merge_conflicts": false},
      "upstream": {"remote": "origin", "branch": "feature", "ahead": 0, "behind": 2},
      "display": {"state": "diverged", "symbols": "!↕", "statusline": "feature …"}
    }
  ]
}
```

How "no value" reads:

- **Absent** — nothing to report: not applicable (`worktree` on a branch-only
  row), not requested this run (the envelope's `collected` records what was),
  or determined-empty (no PR, no lock, not integrated).
- **`null`** — requested but not determined: a task timed out, the branch was
  too stale for the expensive checks, or a forge fetch failed. This is the
  JSON form of the table's `·` placeholder.

jq treats absent and `null` identically in path expressions, so filters need
no null checks; `has()` distinguishes the two when it matters.

Envelope fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `schema` | number | Format version; always `2` |
| `repo` | object | `{default_branch, forge}` — the branch every `default_branch` object measures against (absent when detection failed), and forge metadata derived from the primary remote (absent when no remote URL parses; see [repo object](#repo-object)) |
| `collected` | object | `{ci, summary}` — which gated fact families this run requested, so an absent `pr`/`checks`/`summary` reads as "not requested" rather than "none" |
| `items` | array | One object per row: a worktree, a local branch, or a remote-only branch |

Item fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `branch` | string/null | Branch name; null for a detached-HEAD worktree. Remote rows carry the bare name with the remote in `remote` |
| `remote` | string | Remote name, present only on remote-only branch rows |
| `head` | object/null | HEAD commit (see [head object](#head-object)); null for unborn branches |
| `worktree` | object | Worktree facts (see [worktree object](#worktree-object)); absent on branch-only rows |
| `default_branch` | object | Relation to the default branch (see [default_branch object](#default-branch-object)); absent on the default branch itself |
| `upstream` | object | Tracking branch (see [upstream object](#upstream-object)); absent when none is configured |
| `pr` | object | Open PR/MR (see [pr object](#pr-object)); collected with `--full` |
| `checks` | object | CI pipeline (see [checks object](#checks-object)); collected with `--full` |
| `dev_server` | object | `{url, listening}` from the project's `list.url` template; absent when not configured |
| `summary` | string | LLM branch summary; needs `--full`, `[list] summary = true`, and a `[commit.generation]` command |
| `marker` | string | Branch marker from [`wt config state marker`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-marker); absent when none is set |
| `vars` | object | Per-branch variables from [`wt config state vars`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars) |
| `display` | object | Rendered strings (see [display object](#display-object)) |

### head object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `sha` | string | Full commit SHA (40 chars) |
| `short_sha` | string | Short commit SHA, abbreviated per `core.abbrev` (auto-extends for ambiguous prefixes) |
| `subject` | string/null | Commit subject (first line); null when not loaded, as for a prunable worktree |
| `committed_at` | string/null | Committer time, RFC 3339 UTC; null when not loaded |

### worktree object

Present only on worktree rows. The location attributes are independent, so they co-occur — see [Worktree](#worktree) for the symbols, which pick one:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Worktree path |
| `main` | boolean | Is the main worktree |
| `current` | boolean | Is the worktree the command ran from |
| `previous` | boolean | Is the previous worktree (`wt switch -`) |
| `detached` | boolean | HEAD is detached |
| `locked` | object | `{reason}`; absent when not locked |
| `prunable` | object | `{reason}`; absent when git doesn't report the worktree prunable |
| `branch_mismatch` | boolean | Worktree isn't at the path its branch implies |
| `duplicate_branch` | boolean | Another worktree has the same branch checked out |
| `operation` | string/null | In-progress operation: `"merge"`, `"rebase"`, `"cherry_pick"`, `"revert"`, `"bisect"`; absent when none |
| `changes` | object/null | Working-tree state (see [changes object](#changes-object)) |

### changes object

The five change flags map to the [Working tree](#working-tree) symbols (`renamed` and `deleted` have none of their own):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `staged` | boolean | Has staged files |
| `modified` | boolean | Has modified files (unstaged) |
| `untracked` | boolean | Has untracked files |
| `renamed` | boolean | Has renamed files |
| `deleted` | boolean | Has deleted files |
| `conflicted` | boolean/null | Tracked files carry merge conflicts |
| `diff` | object/null | Lines changed vs HEAD: `{added, deleted}` |

### default_branch object

Independent facts; the table's priority-collapsed symbol is `display.state`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ahead` | number/null | Commits ahead of the default branch (null for orphans) |
| `behind` | number/null | Commits behind the default branch (null for orphans) |
| `diff` | object/null | Lines changed vs the default branch: `{added, deleted}` |
| `orphan` | boolean/null | No common ancestor with the default branch |
| `integration` | object/null | `{reason}` — which check found the content [integrated](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/#branch-cleanup) (see [integration reasons](#integration-reasons)); absent when determined not-integrated, null when a dirty tree skipped the checks |
| `merge_conflicts` | boolean/null | Merging into the default branch would conflict, simulated locally with `git merge-tree` |

### upstream object

`ahead` / `behind` drive the [Remote](#remote) divergence symbol:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `remote` | string | Remote name (e.g., `"origin"`) |
| `branch` | string/null | Branch name on the remote |
| `ahead` | number | Commits ahead of remote |
| `behind` | number | Commits behind remote |

### pr object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `number` | integer/null | PR/MR number |
| `url` | string/null | URL to the PR/MR page |
| `review` | string | Review state (see [review states](#review-states)); absent when the forge reports no review signal |
| `mergeable` | boolean/null | False when the forge reports conflicts, null otherwise — the fetch records only the conflicted case |
| `repo` | object | Structured metadata for the repository the PR/MR targets, the upstream for fork PRs (see [repo object](#repo-object)); absent when the URL doesn't parse |

### checks object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string/null | `"passed"`, `"running"`, or `"failed"`; null when a conflicts report masks it |
| `source` | string | `"pr"` (PR/MR) or `"branch"` (branch workflow) |
| `stale` | boolean | Local HEAD differs from remote (unpushed changes) |

Three [CI status](#ci-status) values have no `checks.status` of their own, because the shape of `pr` and `checks` reports them: a fetch error (`⚠`) makes both null, no CI leaves `checks` absent, and merge conflicts leave `checks.status` null with `pr.mergeable` false.

### dev_server object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Dev server URL from project config |
| `listening` | boolean/null | Whether the URL's port is listening |

### display object

Presentation only — every value here renders facts that appear elsewhere in the item:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `state` | string | The table's collapsed default-branch state (see [state values](#state-values)); absent when none applies |
| `symbols` | string | Raw status symbols without colors (e.g., `"!?↓"`) |
| `statusline` | string | Pre-formatted status with colors and links |
| `columns` | object | Rendered [custom column](#custom-columns) values keyed by header; empty cells omitted |

### repo object

`repo.forge` describes the local checkout's repository as derived from the primary remote. `pr.repo` describes the repository targeted by the PR/MR (for fork PRs, the upstream target).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Repository web URL |
| `provider` | string | `"github"`, `"gitlab"`, `"gitea"`, `"azure-devops"`, or `"unknown"` |
| `host` | string | Repository web host |
| `owner` | string | Owner, organization, or namespace path |
| `name` | string | Repository name |
| `project` | string | Azure DevOps project name; absent for other providers |
| `remote` | string | Local remote name; present on `repo.forge`, absent from `pr.repo` |

### state values

The single highest-priority state describing the branch's relation to the default branch; absent when none applies (a normal up-to-date branch). Each value is one Default-branch symbol — see [Default branch](#default-branch) for the symbol and the full meaning of each value (`"is_main"`, `"orphan"`, `"empty"`, `"integrated"`, `"would_conflict"`, `"same_commit"`, `"diverged"`, `"ahead"`, `"behind"`).

### integration reasons

`default_branch.integration.reason` records which check matched. Checks run cheapest-first and the first match wins. JSON-only — every reason renders as the same `⊂`:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `"same_commit"` | Branch HEAD is the default branch's commit |
| `"ancestor"` | Branch HEAD is an ancestor of the default branch, which has moved past it |
| `"no_added_changes"` | The three-dot diff (`main...branch`) is empty — no file changes beyond the merge-base |
| `"trees_match"` | Different history, but the branch's tree is identical to the default branch's |
| `"merge_adds_nothing"` | The branch has changes, but merging them leaves the default branch's tree unchanged (e.g. a squash merge where the target advanced on other files) |
| `"patch_id_match"` | The branch's squashed diff matches a single commit on the default branch (e.g. a GitHub/GitLab squash merge) |

### review states

`pr.review` is one of `"changes_requested"`, `"pending"`, `"draft"`, `"approved"`, absent when the forge reports no review signal. The [CI status](#ci-status) section is the single source: its table maps the colored values, and the notes below it cover `"draft"` and `"approved"`. The vocabulary matches Claude Code's statusline `pr.review_state` field.

A JSON Schema for the envelope is published at
[worktrunk.dev/schema/list-v2.json](https://worktrunk.dev/schema/list-v2.json).
It describes what `wt` writes, so a field the absence rule can omit is
optional there rather than required-and-null.

### Schema 1

The original bare-array format — one object per row, no envelope — selected by
`[list] json-schema = 1`. Its fields all have a schema-2 home:

| Schema 1 | Schema 2 |
|----------|----------|
| `branch` | `branch` |
| `path` | `worktree.path` |
| `kind` | the row's shape — a `worktree` object means `"worktree"`, no `worktree` object means `"branch"` |
| `commit.sha`, `.short_sha`, `.message` | `head.sha`, `.short_sha`, `.subject` |
| `commit.timestamp` (Unix) | `head.committed_at` (RFC 3339 UTC) |
| `working_tree.staged`, `.modified`, `.untracked`, `.renamed`, `.deleted`, `.diff` | `worktree.changes.*` |
| `operation_state` `"conflicts"` | `worktree.changes.conflicted` |
| `operation_state` `"rebase"`, `"merge"`, … | `worktree.operation` |
| `main_state` | `display.state` |
| `integration_reason` | `default_branch.integration.reason` (snake_case, and it reports `"same_commit"` rather than folding it into `main_state`) |
| `main.ahead`, `.behind`, `.diff` | `default_branch.ahead`, `.behind`, `.diff` |
| `remote.name`, `.branch`, `.ahead`, `.behind` | `upstream.remote`, `.branch`, `.ahead`, `.behind` |
| `worktree.state` | `worktree.locked`, `.prunable`, `.duplicate_branch`, `.branch_mismatch` — independent, so they co-occur |
| `worktree.reason` | `worktree.locked.reason`, `worktree.prunable.reason` |
| `worktree.detached` | `worktree.detached` |
| `is_main`, `is_current`, `is_previous` | `worktree.main`, `.current`, `.previous` |
| `ci.status` | `checks.status`, plus the shapes described under [checks object](#checks-object) |
| `ci.source`, `ci.stale` | `checks.source`, `checks.stale` |
| `ci.number`, `ci.url`, `ci.review_state` | `pr.number`, `pr.url`, `pr.review` |
| `ci.repo`, `ci.repo_url` | `pr.repo`, `pr.repo.url` |
| `repo`, `repo_url` | the envelope's `repo.forge`, `repo.forge.url` |
| `url`, `url_active` | `dev_server.url`, `dev_server.listening` |
| `summary`, `vars`, `marker` | `summary`, `vars`, `marker` |
| `statusline`, `symbols`, `columns` | `display.statusline`, `display.symbols`, `display.columns` |

The envelope's `repo.default_branch` and `collected` have no schema-1 equivalent, and schema 2 separates "nothing to report" from "not determined" — see [How "no value" reads](#schema-2).

# Subcommands

## wt list statusline

Single-line status for the current worktree.

The line carries the same cells as the worktree's row in `wt list`. A stale CI status cache makes it reach the network for a second or two, so it fits a statusline the host renders in the background — Claude Code's, a `tmux` status bar — better than a prompt the shell blocks on. Want it fast enough for a synchronous prompt? Open an issue at https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk.

### Output formats

- `table` (default): `branch  status  HEAD±  main↕  main…±  Remote⇅  CI  URL`
- `json`: the current [`wt list --format=json`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#json-output) schema — a one-item envelope by default, or a one-item array with `[list] json-schema = 1`
- `claude-code`: the `table` cells, preceded by `dir` and followed by `model  context  pace`

A cell with nothing to show is left out rather than blanked, so most lines are shorter than that; `claude-code` also drops `branch` where `dir` already ends in `.<branch>`. A line that still overruns the terminal drops whole cells, least important first, starting with the dev server URL.

The CI reference links to its PR/MR, and a dev server URL carrying a port shows as `:3000` linking to the URL in full, dim until something answers on that port. Both are underlined, which is what marks them as clickable. They are OSC 8 links, and a terminal that doesn't support those discards the escape, leaving the underlined text unclickable.

### Claude Code mode

`--format=claude-code` reads JSON context from stdin (`.workspace.current_dir` is required; the rest are optional):

- `.workspace.current_dir` — working directory
- `.model.display_name` — model name
- `.context_window.used_percentage` — context usage (0–100), rendered as `🌔 65%`, the moon waning 🌕→🌑 as context fills
- `.rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.used_percentage` — rate-limit window usage (0–100)
- `.rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.resets_at` — window reset time (Unix epoch seconds)

The pace segment appears only when usage is likely to hit a rate limit before its window resets, and shows the higher-risk window: `2.9×(Tue–Tue 5pm)` reads as 2.9× the pace that would exactly fill that window. Above 90% used it shows usage instead of pace — `93%(Tue–Tue 5pm)` — near the cap, how much is left matters more than how fast it's going. "Likely" is a Bayesian forecast; early-window bursts don't trigger it. Its colour deepens with severity — dim, then dim-yellow, then yellow — as the forecast lockout (how much of the window would be spent capped) grows, so a fast pace that would only tip over near the reset stays dim rather than alarming. With `-vv`, each window's inputs and projection are logged to `.git/wt/logs/trace.log`.

[Claude Code statusline setup](https://worktrunk.dev/claude-code/#statusline-claude-code-only) has the `~/.claude/settings.json` entry that feeds this mode.
